**AD Sex-Biased Genomics & Proteomics**

# PheWAS
A Phenome-Wide Association Study (PheWAS) tests whether a genetic variant or locus is associated with many phenotypes across the phenome, revealing trait-wide effects.

This project: We re-analyze PheWAS across **two tissues—CSF and plasma—**using R, treating protein weights as phenotypes and running parallel, reproducible pipelines per tissue.

## Data sources
- Plasma protein weights and phenotype data from [Yang et al., 2025](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-62463-w#data-availability).

- CSF protein weights from [Western et al. 2024](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-024-01972-8).
