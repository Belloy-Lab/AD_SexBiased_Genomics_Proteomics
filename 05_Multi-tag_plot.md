**AD Sex-Biased Genomics & Proteomics**

## Multi-tag plot 
Multi-tag plots integrating AD GWAS, pQTL, and other QTL datasets for up to three lead variants were generated to visualize the genetic architecture surrounding PWAS-prioritized genes.

- Multitag_plot_PSEN1.R – main driver for the PSEN1 gene.

- Multitag_plot_function.R – helper functions for windowing, merging, LD, and plotting.

```bash
Rscript Analysis_codes/Multitag_plot_PSEN1.R
```
