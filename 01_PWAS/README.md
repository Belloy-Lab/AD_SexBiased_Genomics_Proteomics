**Sex Strat AD PWAS**

## Methods
Sex-stratified and sex-heterogeneity AD GWAS were conducted in European ancestry individuals using a 3-stage design, followed by fixed-effects meta-analysis. PWAS were conducted via FUSION, combining sex-stratified AD GWAS with sex-matched and non-sex-stratified protein-specific variant weights, respectively. Significant findings in European ancestry were evaluated for sex heterogeneity consistency with admixed African ancestry AD GWAS (improved sex heterogeneity P-value upon fixed-effects meta-analysis) and PWAS (sample-size weighted Z-score combination improved in matching sex and non-significant Z-score (P>0.05) in opposite sex).

The primary discovery represents a fully sex-matched PWAS. The secondary discovery used non-stratified pQTL data to leverage its additional power and assess the relevance of sex-matching in gene discovery. Significant findings were subsequently filtered for nominally significant outcomes in male analyses to prioritize female-specific AD associated genes.
