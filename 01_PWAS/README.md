**AD Sex-Biased Genomics & Proteomics**

PWAS were conducted via FUSION, combining sex-stratified AD GWAS with sex-matched and non-sex-stratified protein-specific variant weights, respectively, in both brain and CSF samples. Primary anlayses used European ancestry GWAS as input. Sensitivity anlayses used a subset of European ancestry GWAS as input. Exploratory consistency analyses used African ancestry GWAS as input.
