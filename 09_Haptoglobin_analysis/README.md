# Haptoglobin Analyses

Haptoglobin (HP) was identified in GWAS, PWAS, and gene prioritization analsyes. The locus has a well known structural variant HP1/HP2, which was further investigated. Using long-read sequencing data from the Stanford ADRC & SAMS cohorts, a Support Vector Classifier was trained to predict HP1 genotype and perform HP1 imputation in GWAS stages 1 & 2, as well as avaiable CSF and brain proteogenomics samples. A Phenome-Wide Association Study (PheWAS) was then conducted in CSF and brain proteogenomics samples spanning the HP locus and all available proteins.
