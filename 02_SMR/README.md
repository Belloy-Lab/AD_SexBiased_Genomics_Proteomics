**AD Sex-Biased Genomics & Proteomics**

# Summary-based Mendelian Randomization (SMR) Analysis Pipeline

This repository documents a complete pipeline to perform SMR analysis integrating sex-stratified GWAS and pQTL datasets from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and brain tissue to identify potential causal genes for Alzheimer's Disease (AD).

## 🔬 Overview

SMR analysis is used to test for causal relationships between gene expression (or protein abundance) and complex traits using summary-level data from GWAS and QTL studies. This pipeline focuses on:

* Sex-stratified SMR for female and male AD GWAS datasets
* Integration with protein QTLs (pQTLs) derived from CSF and brain tissues
* Generation of `.besd` format for QTL datasets
