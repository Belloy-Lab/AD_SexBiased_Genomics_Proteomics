**AD Sex-Biased Genomics & Proteomics**

## Summary-based Mendelian Randomization (SMR) Analysis Pipeline

---

SMR analyses were conducted across GWAS and pQTL datasets from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and brain tissue to validate genes identified in AD PWAS.

## 🔬 Overview

This pipeline covers:

* Integration with protein QTLs (pQTLs) derived from CSF and brain tissues
* Generation of `.besd` format for QTL datasets
  Sex-stratified SMR for female and male AD GWAS datasets
