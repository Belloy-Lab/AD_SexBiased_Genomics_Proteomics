**AD Sex-Biased Genomics & Proteomics**

# Summary-based Mendelian Randomization (SMR) Analysis Pipeline
This repository documents a complete pipeline to perform SMR analysis integrating sex-stratified GWAS and pQTL datasets from CSF and brain tissue to identify potential causal genes for Alzheimer's Disease (AD).

## 🔬 Overview

This pipeline covers:

* Integration with protein QTLs (pQTLs) derived from CSF and brain tissues
* Generation of `.besd` format for QTL datasets
  Sex-stratified SMR for female and male AD GWAS datasets
