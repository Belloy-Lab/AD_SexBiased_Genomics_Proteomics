**AD Sex-Biased Genomics & Proteomics**

## Cell-Type Enrichment
We assessed cellular specificity of sex-specific prioritized genes using the method of [Western et al. (2024)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-024-01972-8). Cell type–specific expression data for endothelial cells, oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, neurons, and microglia/macrophages were obtained from [Zhang et al.(2016)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627315010193?via%3Dihub).
